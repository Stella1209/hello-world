  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a digital world.  Thanks to the social media, we are connected to people and information 24/7, no matter where we are. Social media has expanded the role of being a media consumer into one where people create and share as easily as they consume. While a site like Facebook appears to dominate, social media is much more than that. Social media is a wealth of applications—wikis, blogs, and curation tools in addition to social networks—that allow us to connect with other people, find information, and share all kinds of content, from videos and text to images. Mobile technologies like smartphones and tablets have removed the geographic boundaries for use and significantly reduced socioeconomic barriers. The appeal of social media is tremendous—it triggers our fundamental drive for social connection and allows us more control over our world. </p>

  <p><strong>The Psychological Changes from Social Networking</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some people are natural networkers, and have an easy time reaching out to others, many shy away from traditional networking opportunities because they see them as an unnatural and uncomfortable means of promoting themselves and connecting with others, especially with strangers. The Internet provides an opportunity for anyone to create an identity online, connect with friends, family and strangers alike, acquire knowledge, and share ideas and information without having to be physically present. Instead, one’s presence is represented on social media by shared comments, photos, videos, and other images.

Social networking is now integrated into the day-to-day lives of most people who use the Internet. The psychology of social networking explores the identities, relationships, communication techniques, and behaviors that develop from these connections. Psychologists look at how different people develop, maintain, and use their online presence and how they are affected by the technology that allows them to do so.</p>

<p><strong>The Emotional Influence by Social Networking</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that we are finding ourselves using technology for a variety of reasons ranging from anxiety to pleasure (positive attitudes). What does it all mean? From our study alone it appears that people are using their technology for a combination of gaining some pleasure and from avoiding anxiety about not knowing what is going on at every moment on every electronic communication platform including social media. If I had to estimate the contributions to our behavior I would say that our data support about a 3:1 ratio of anxiety reduction to pleasure. We are still checking in all the time to gain a bit of pleasure (perhaps a squirt of dopamine or serotonin) but I think that what is driving our behavior of constantly checking in with our technology regardless of whether we have received an alert or notification—an external interruption—or we are musing about missing out on something in our virtual social world—an internal interruption—is akin to an obsession or compulsion, both of which are anxiety-driven issues. We have not sunk to the level of a psychiatric disorder like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder but we are not far away. Just watch people in the world around you. If you are watching a young person who is not looking at his or her phone keep watching. Soon that phone will come out of the pocket or purse, most likely without having gotten an alert or notification but being driven by a combination of pleasure and anxiety.</p>

<p><strong>The suffering Both Mentally and Physically through Social Networking</strong><br>
It may also seem that you're putting out a lot of effort for what you get in return.  Not liking doing something plus not being successful at it are a recipe for burnout."Boredom occurs when I fail to make the other person interesting."
